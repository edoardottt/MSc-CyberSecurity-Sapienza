# Security in Software Applications

- Prof. Francesco Parisi Presicce(http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~parisi/)
- the course website is on Moodle

I had the pleasure and honor of being a student of Prof. Parisi Presicce. It's sad to say this was the last semester before he passed away.

#### Course Description  
Theory and practice of software security, focusing in particular on some common software security risks, including buffer overflows, race conditions and random number generation, and on the identification of potential threats and vulnerabilities early in the design cycle. The emphasis is on methodologies and tools for identifying and eliminating security vulnerabilities, techniques to prove the absence of vulnerabilities, and ways to avoid security holes in new software, and on essential guidelines for building secure software: how to design software with security in mind from the ground up and to integrate analysis and risk management throughout the software life cycle.
