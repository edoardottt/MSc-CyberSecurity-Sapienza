Ethical hackers are a category of professionals increasingly in demand by companies and governments aware of the need to effectively protect their infrastructure from possible cyberattacks. The course deals with the fundamentals of ethical hacking. In particular, it starts from the systematic study of the methodologies and tools used by hackers to carry out the various attacks in the cyberspace. Next, it illustrates how the professional of ethical hacking can carry out a series of legal and useful activities by subjecting the computer systems to vulnerability tests. These tests are intended to evaluate and prove the cybersecurity of an organization and to help owners and managers to become aware of, and solve their cybersecurity problems.  Particular attention is paid to the practical application of the concepts learnt.
