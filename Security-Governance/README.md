The main objective of the course is to provide an introduction to all issues related to the cyber security management. In particular, the course will highlight that cyber security is a vertical problem with respect to the organization. Consequently, its management impacts different levels.
Aspects related to international and national regulations and standards will be analyzed. Then, it will be discussed how, from the methodological point of view, these aspects are taken in to account and implemented by defining security frameworks.
Finally, another fundamental aspect of the course will be to present methods and open problems to carry out auditing, verification, compliance and certification activities considering specific techniques and tools that can be used for this purpose.
