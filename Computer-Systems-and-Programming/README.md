These are the topics that are planned to be described during the course. Of course mileage may vary, depending on time available, etc.

- Programming environment: compiler, make & makefiles, gdb debugger
- Recap of the C programming language: variables, costants, operators, expressions, control instructions, functions, pointers, arrays, structures & unions, preprocessor directives
- Operating system basics (Linux): processes, filesystem, inter-process communication primitives (signals, pipes, semaphores, shared memory)
- Thread programming: pthread management, mutual exclusion, synchronization
- Network programming: sockets, raw sockets, sniffers
- Software vulnerabilities: buffer overflows, heap corruption, pointer subterfuge, etc.
