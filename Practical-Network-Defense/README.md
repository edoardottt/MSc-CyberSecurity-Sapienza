#### Overview

The course explains the fundamentals of the methods and tools for the protection of computer networks. Particular attention is paid to the practical application of the concepts learned:  commonly-seen threats arising from the use of particular protocols in networked computer systems, mechanisms commonly used by intruders and designers of malware in order to compromise a computer system's security, the basic mechanisms used for the detection of intrusion attempts in computer systems.  
At the end of the course students will be able to monitor traffic in networks, apply a security policy, perform a network scan and search for vulnerabilities in a computer network. Students will develop the ability to select the appropriate firewall rules to protect a network, select the most appropriate mechanisms to protect a networked computer system and to make the most appropriate design choices to implement a "defense in depth" strategy, using isolated networks and dedicated tools (VPN, proxy and firewall).  
Students will develop the analytical skills necessary to evaluate different alternatives during the design process of a computer network, with particular reference to the evaluation of the architectural choices and related risks and to the security objectives that the system wants to pursue.  
Students will learn how to document their choices, also through the use of automated reporting tools. They will also have acquired the ability to prepare presentations related to specific scientific topics.  
The concepts acquired during the course will provide students with a solid knowledge base in order to further deepen the more technical aspects, explore the alternatives not dealt with for time reasons and to autonomously keep themselves informed on the continuous developments and updates of network security and protection.
