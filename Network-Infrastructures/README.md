#### Overview

The course presents the basic concepts, protocols and architectures of the current network infrastructures. Specific attention is given to the broadband access, the optical backbone and the wireless networking in the future generation. Furthermore, main technologies leading to the QoS support in a network infrastructure are described as well as IPv6. At the end of the course the students will have competences in technologies and network infrastructures presented in the course like: xDSL, PON, LTE, 5G, SDN. Network control and secure protocols will also be discussed. Network control will be addressed by dealing with MPLS, Segment Routing and the new paradigms of Software Defined Networks. The mechanisms of network vritualization will also be presented.  
Also secure protocols will be addressed. Moreover, they will be able to configure and analyze an IP based network by using the Kathar√† tool. Specific projects carried out during the course will allow the students to apply their knowledge to innovative network scenarios and applications.
